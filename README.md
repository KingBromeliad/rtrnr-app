# The App

During this pandemic, with the reopening of the gyms, the accumulated months of sedentary lifestyle and all
the advantages of being followed in training to get back in shape I tried to find an idea
to reconcile and facilitate these aspects.
 
The result was Remote Trainer: a cross-platform mobile application to speed up
your workout and track your progress with the assistance of a personal trainer.
Remote Trainer is developed primarily for assisted trainers, despite this the platform
it is complete and offers full functionality to those who manage customers and create training schedules.
The client has a simple and immediate application available that allows you to carry out the
workouts assigned in an interactive and intelligent way: all the series of each are shown
exercise with their own rest timers, plus options for learning exercises and more
functionality, Remote Trainer allows you to change the loads performed (series, weight, repetitions) and one
once the training is completed, it generates a report that tracks progress and difficulties
found. These reports combined with personal data, compiled by the user, on their physical improvements
they are immediately available to the personal trainer who will use them to balance workouts
current and create new ones following the evolution and personal feedback of each customer.
The personal trainer has all the tools necessary to manage multiple clients through the
same app: a library of exercises managed by him, access to the personal data of each client, access
to the history and reports of each training session practiced by each of them, an instrument
powerful and efficient for creating and editing workouts: adding exercises from the library
customizing each parameter, providing everything with notes and indications; also can
add social contacts and contact details visible to its customers to facilitate communication.
